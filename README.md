# Basic-Data-Analysis-Projects

This repository features five beginner-to-intermediate level projects that apply data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. Each project focuses on real-world datasets to practice data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy. The collection highlights essential data science skills such as data wrangling, visualization, feature engineering, and regression analysis—core competencies for analytical and technical computing.

Demographic Data Analyzer: Analyzes demographic information from a census dataset to compute key statistics such as race distribution, education level, work hours, and income percentages.

Medical Data Visualizer: Explores patient health data to visualize correlations between lifestyle habits, clinical measurements, and cardiovascular disease.

Page View Time Series Visualizer: Processes website traffic data to visualize daily page views over time, analyze monthly trends, and compare yearly patterns.

Sea Level Predictor: Uses historical global sea level data to model and predict future sea level rise through linear regression.

Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator: Performs statistical analysis on a 3×3 matrix to compute mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum values along rows, columns, and the flattened dataset.
